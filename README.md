# Hangman-Game
Hangman, 80's style! 

Enjoy this retro throw-back to history's game of torture & trivia! Luckily, you're not under the noose on this one - but we hope you play like your life depended on it.

For those of you unfamiliar with the game, tough.  Just kidding! Simply click the link here https://kerrickwoyshner.github.io/Hangman-Game/ to open up the game, and begin by guessing the letters that comprise the word formed by the underscores ("_").

The application will tally the number of correct words you deciphered, and begin testing you on a different word once you've exceeded the maximum number of guesses.

Hopefully you don't get too "hung up" on this one xD
